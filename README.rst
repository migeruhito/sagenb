SageWui
=======

Development moved to https://github.com/damahou/sagewui
Information here is obsolete.

SageWui is a major refactor/rewrite of the Sage Notebook.

Status
======

* *The notebook is now independent from Sage*, so that it can be launched from
  an independent python interpreter.
  
* *Porting to Python 3 completed*. Bug fixes in progress.

* A new package `sagewui` created. It runs on a
  indpendent python interpreter.

* `smtpsend` is now a global module.

* `sagenb` package contains only sage (incomplete) compatibility code.
  Work in progress.

* Notebook startup procedure has been changed. No need for intermediate startup
  code files. Standalone command interface. Debug mode added. Work in progress.

* Sage server interface totally isolated. No
  need for intermediate code files. Code is passed directly to the
  Sage server. Sage initialization left to the `sage_server` interface.
  Work in progress.

* New flask json session mechanism adopted.

* A lot of reformatting, bug fixing and simplification of code done.
  Work in progress.

TODO
=====

* Break the notebook in more packages (WebApp, sage_server interface,
  model, controller, ...) useful to develop other independent software.

* Objects must be processed by the client for displaying. No more html
  representation of objects must be generated by the server. Establish
  a clear web server API, so that different web clients could be
  implemented.
  
* Interact code refactor.

* Improve maintainability.

* Improve security, both in the WebApp and in the sage_server interactions.

* Improve scalability.

* ...


Notes
=====

* The dependencies for `sagewui` are: `twisted`, `flask`,
  `flask-openid`, `flask-autoindex`, `flask-babel`,
  `flask-themes2`, `future`, `smtpsend`, `pexpect`, `docutils`, `jsmin`,
  `pyopenssl`, `service_identity`.
  All of them, but `smtpsend`
  which is in the source tree, are installable from pipy in an virtual
  python environment.

* `send_mail` disabled under py3. Twisted.mail port needed.

* Backward compatibility is not a goal, but at this moment this version
  can be used as a replacement of the current Sage Notebook.

* Some Notebook features could be removed.
